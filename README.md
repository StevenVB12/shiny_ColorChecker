# shiny_ColorChecker

R shiny app for calibrating images using a ColorChecker.

https://stevenvanbelleghem.shinyapps.io/shiny_colorchecker/

Run in R (shinyapps.io has restrictions on memory usage, so may fail for large images):
```
runGitHub("shiny_ColorChecker","StevenVB12")
```

This function is also available in the patternize R package (see https://github.com/StevenVB12/patternize, allows batch processing).
